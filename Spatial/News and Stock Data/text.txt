News and Stock Data – Originally prepared for a deep learning and NLP class, this dataset was meant to be used for a binary classification task. News and Stock Data includes historical news headlines crawled from Reddit’s r/worldnews subreddit from June 8th, 2008 to July 1st, 2016. Additionally, it includes Dow Jones Industrial Average data from August 8th, 2008 to July 1st, 2016.

There are two channels of data provided in this dataset:

News data: I crawled historical news headlines from Reddit WorldNews Channel (/r/worldnews). They are ranked by reddit users' votes, and only the top 25 headlines are considered for a single date.
(Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01)

Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to "prove the concept".
(Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)

I provided three data files in .csv format:

RedditNews.csv: two columns
The first column is the "date", and second column is the "news headlines".
All news are ranked from top to bottom based on how hot they are.
Hence, there are 25 lines for each date.

Combined_News_DJIA.csv:
To make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns.
The first column is "Date", the second is "Label", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from "Top1" to "Top25".
